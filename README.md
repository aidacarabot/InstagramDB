# InstagramDB üì∏

InstagramDB is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, designed to simulate an Instagram database. It allows creation, reading, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of user accounts and posts, including uploading and managing images via Cloudinary.

The API‚Äôs authentication system uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to protect routes, ensuring only authenticated users can perform operations. Authentication is done using the Bearer scheme, where users receive a JWT token upon login, which must be included in the request headers for protected routes.

User passwords are managed using bcrypt to ensure secure storage, hashing passwords before saving them in the database. This guarantees that even if the database is compromised, original passwords won‚Äôt be exposed.

## Features ‚ú®

- **Full CRUD**: Complete CRUD operations for `Accounts` and `Posts` collections.
- **üìÅ File Uploads**: Handling of image uploads for user profiles (`profilePicture`) and posts (`imageUrl`), stored in Cloudinary.
- **üóëÔ∏è File Deletion**: Automatic removal of images stored in Cloudinary when an `Account` or `Post` is deleted.
- **üîó Collection Relations**: `Posts` are related to `Accounts` via a MongoDB reference.
- **üîí Authentication**: User authentication using JWT, with route protection via the Bearer scheme.
- **üõ°Ô∏è Security**: Password management with bcrypt to securely store passwords.
- **üå± Data Seeds**: Scripts to seed initial data into the database.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side code.
- **Express**: Node.js framework for building web apps and APIs.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: NoSQL database for storing accounts and posts.
- **Mongoose**: ODM to model data in MongoDB.
- **Cloudinary**: Image management service used to store profile and post images.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling HTTP file uploads.
- **bcrypt**: For password hashing.
- **jsonwebtoken**: For JWT creation and verification.
- **dotenv**: Module for managing environment variables.

## Installation üöÄ

Follow these steps to clone and set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aidact3/InstagramDB.git
   cd InstagramDB
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root with these variables:
   ```
   DB_URL=<your_mongoDB_atlas_url>
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloudinary_cloud_name>
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_cloudinary_api_key>
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your_cloudinary_api_secret>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
   ```

4. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Endpoints

- **POST /api/v1/account/**: Create a new account.
  - **Request parameters (form-data)**:
    - `username`: Username (string).
    - `password`: User password (string).
    - `bio`: User biography (string).
    - `profilePicture`: Profile image (file).

- **POST /api/v1/account/login**: Authenticate user and return JWT token.
  - **Request parameters (JSON)**:
    - `username`: Username (string).
    - `password`: User password (string).

- **GET /api/v1/account/**: Get all accounts. **(Requires Bearer Token)**

- **GET /api/v1/account/:id**: Get account by ID. **(Requires Bearer Token)**

- **PUT /api/v1/account/:id**: Update an existing account. **(Requires Bearer Token)**
  - **Request parameters (form-data)**:
    - `username`: Username (string).
    - `password`: User password (string, optional).
    - `bio`: User biography (string).
    - `profilePicture`: Profile image (file).

- **DELETE /api/v1/account/:id**: Delete an account by ID (including image in Cloudinary). **(Requires Bearer Token)**

### Posts

- **POST /api/v1/posts/**: Create a new post. **(Requires Bearer Token)**
  - **Request parameters (form-data)**:
    - `caption`: Post description (string).
    - `image`: Post image (file).
    - `account`: Associated account ID (ObjectId).

- **GET /api/v1/posts/**: Get all posts. **(Requires Bearer Token)**

- **GET /api/v1/posts/:id**: Get post by ID. **(Requires Bearer Token)**

- **PUT /api/v1/posts/:id**: Update an existing post. **(Requires Bearer Token)**
  - **Request parameters (form-data)**:
    - `caption`: Post description (string).
    - `image`: Post image (file).

- **DELETE /api/v1/posts/:id**: Delete a post by ID (including image in Cloudinary). **(Requires Bearer Token)**

## Data Seeds

To populate the database with initial data, you can run included seed scripts:

- **Accounts**:
  ```bash
  npm run seedAccount
  ```

- **Posts**:
  ```bash
  npm run seedPost
  ```

These scripts will create sample accounts and posts in your database.

## File Management in Cloudinary

### Uploading Images

Images are uploaded to Cloudinary and stored in specific folders based on the data type:

- **Profile_Pictures**: Folder for user profile images.
- **Instagram_Posts**: Folder for images related to posts.

### Deleting Images

Images are automatically deleted from Cloudinary when the corresponding account or post is deleted from the database. This ensures no orphaned files remain in Cloudinary storage.

## Reusing Storage in Cloudinary

The project supports reusing Cloudinary storage by dynamically setting the destination folder for uploaded images, allowing different file types to be stored in appropriate subfolders within the same project. This helps keep media content organized and can be customized or commented as needed.

## Token Authentication and Bearer Scheme

### Authentication

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate users. When a user successfully logs in, they receive a JWT token. This token must be included in the Authorization header of requests to protected routes using the **Bearer** scheme.

### Bearer Scheme

The JWT token is sent in requests using the Bearer scheme:

```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```
